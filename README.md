Cream
=====

An auto-curried Scheme-like language implemented in JavaScript


The easiest way to test it out is by running this in the root of the project:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    
And then navigating to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/ "localhost:8000") 

If you don't want to download it yourself you can test it on my [website](http://bjornmagnus.co.uk/cream/ "bjornmagnus.co.uk/cream").
